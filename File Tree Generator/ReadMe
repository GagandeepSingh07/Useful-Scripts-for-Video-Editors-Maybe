# FOLDER TREE GENERATOR

# Purpose

This script generates a visual directory tree for a user-specified folder.
It prints the folder structure to the console and simultaneously writes the
same structure to a text file named "file_tree.txt".

The output format mirrors common tree-style directory listings, making it
useful for documentation, audits, codebase overviews, or sharing project
structures.

Warning:
- Open File "Tree Generator Directory" in your favorite code editor.
- This script may take a long time to process very large directories.
- The output file is always overwritten if it already exists.
- Unicode box-drawing characters are used; ensure your editor supports UTF-8.

# How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter a folder path.

2. The script validates that the provided path exists and is a directory.
   - If the path is invalid, the script exits with an error message.

3. The script recursively traverses the directory using os.listdir():
   - Directory contents are sorted alphabetically.
   - Each file and folder is prefixed with tree connectors:
         ├── for intermediate items
         └── for the last item in a directory
   - Indentation is adjusted to visually represent nesting levels.

4. For each item encountered:
   - The formatted line is printed to the terminal.
   - The same line is written to "file_tree.txt" using UTF-8 encoding.

5. If a subdirectory is encountered, the function calls itself recursively
   with updated indentation to continue building the tree.

6. Permission errors (e.g., restricted folders) are safely ignored so the
   script can continue processing accessible paths.

# Output

- Console output displaying the directory tree
- A text file named "file_tree.txt" containing the same tree structure

# Example Output

├── src
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils.py
└── README.md

# Usage

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the full or relative path to a folder.
3. Review the printed tree in the console.
4. Open "file_tree.txt" to access the saved directory structure.

Notes
-----
- The output file is always overwritten if it already exists.
- Unicode box-drawing characters are used; ensure your editor supports UTF-8.
- This script is platform-independent and works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
