# Cut SRT Generator

## Overview

The **Cut SRT Generator** is a Python utility that converts simple, human-readable
time range instructions into an SRT subtitle file containing **CUT markers**.
This is useful for video editing workflows where subtitle files are used to
define cuts, markers, or edit points in an NLE (e.g., Premiere Pro, Resolve).

The script supports frame-accurate timing and optional automatic insertion
of an initial cut at the start of the timeline.

## Features

- Outputs a valid `.srt` subtitle file with `CUT` entries
- Frame-accurate timing using configurable FPS (default: 29.97)
- Optional automatic initial cut at `00:00:00`
- No external dependencies (standard library only)

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- No third-party packages required
